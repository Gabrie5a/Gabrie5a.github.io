            Himeji Castle (姫路城 or Himeji-jō) is a castle complex in 
            the city of Himeji in the Hyōgo Prefecture of Japan. It is 
            also known as “Hakuro-jō” or “Shirasagi-jō” (translated to 
            "White Egret Castle" or "White Heron Castle") because of its 
            white plaster walls and appearance, which resemble a white 
            heron taking flight. It is the largest castle in Japan, 
            comprising 82 buildings.

        There are magnificent views from from the top level of the 
        castle over Himeji City and out to the Ejima Islands in the 
        Inland Sea. The castle is particularly attractive in cherry 
        blossom season when the hundreds of cherry trees in the castle 
        grounds are in full pink bloom.
