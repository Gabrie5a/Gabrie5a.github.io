    <p>Hyogo is a prefecture in Japan located in the Kansai region of Honshu. 
        It is bordered by the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean, 
        resulting in a diversified climate throughout the year.</p>

          <p>Kobe beef is a highly marbled type of Wagyu beef that comes 
              from the Tajima cattle strain of the Japanese Black breed. 
              In addition to the breed of cattle, meat labeled “Kobe” must 
              be born and raised in Hyogo Prefecture and killed in 
              local slaughterhouses. <br>Kobe beef has a Meat Quality Score of 4–5.
              The Kobe cattle themselves must be heifers or bullocks (aka virgin 
              cows). Only 3,000–5,000 head of cattle meet these restrictions each 
              year.

          <p>Himeji Castle (姫路城, Himejijō), also known as White Heron Castle 
              (Shirasagijo) due to its elegant, white appearance, is widely 
              considered as Japan's most spectacular castle for its imposing size and 
              beauty and its well preserved, complex castle grounds.<br> The castle is 
              both a national treasure and a world heritage site. Unlike many other 
              Japanese castles, it was never destroyed by war, earthquake or fire and 
              survives to this day as one of the country's twelve original castles.
