        <p>Kobe Beef is a highly prized type of Wagyu beef that comes 
            from the Japanese Black breed's Tajima cattle strain. It is 
            the most widely known regional specialty food in Japan. 
            The Kobe meat must be born and raised in Hyogo Prefecture 
            and killed in local slaughterhouses. It is one of the several
            breeds of Japanese cattle that are bred throughout the country 
            and linked with the area where they are raised.
